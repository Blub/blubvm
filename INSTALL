Getting the code
****************

  1. `cd' to your nexuiz configuration folder. (eg.: ~/.nexuiz/data)
  2. Clone the repository using:
       git clone http://git.rear.endoftheinternet.org/blubvm.git
  3. Now you're ready to use the code.

Installation
************

   If you have a copy of the blubvm files elsewhere than described in
`Getting the code' then you simply have to put the *.cfg files into a folder
called blubvm/ in your nexuiz configuration folder.

   You can either use your user-configuration directory, or the directory in
which  the  game  itself  is  installed.  (eg.: ~/.nexuiz/data or
/usr/share/games/nexuiz if that's where it is installed.)

     mkdir ~/.nexuiz/data/blubvm
     cp *.cfg ~/.nexuiz/data/blubvm
